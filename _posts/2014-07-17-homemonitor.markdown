description: Home Monitor is one of two products that I came to own for this client, the other being BabyPing. Whilst owning the product I was responsible for the design and development of the Home Monitor iOS (iPad & iPhone) and Android phone and tablet projects. The products were clients that talked to the Home Monitor servers that allowed users to view their Home Monitor cameras from anywhere in the world. As well as being able to stream live footage, the apps allowed users to view archived footage that had been recorded based on Motion Detection and would also send push notifications when any motion was detected. Other features I worked with the client to put in involved, sharing for archived footage via social networks, changing the settings of a camera using purely the app, and also improving the connectivity with the apps to the cameras, reducing the live streaming lag from 15 seconds to 6 seconds.
